Predictive Text Generator (Algonive Internship Project)

This project is developed by **Umme Kulsum** during my **Python Programming Internship with Algonive**.
The Predictive Text Generator is a simple yet effective application that suggests the next word while typing. It is inspired by mobile-style typing assistants and demonstrates the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in Python.

ðŸ”¹ Features
- ðŸ“Œ Word Prediction â€“ suggests the next word as you type.
- ðŸ“Œ Context Awareness â€“ predictions change depending on typed words.
- ðŸ“Œ Machine Learning â€“ implemented with a simple N-gram / Markov Chain model.
- ðŸ“Œ Mobile-Style GUI â€“ interactive interface that looks like a smartphone.
